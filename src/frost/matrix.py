"""
The Matrix module provides classes and utilities for performing various matrix
operations, particularly focusing on applications within finite fields, often
used in cryptographic computations.

This module includes:
- The Matrix class which supports standard matrix operations such as
  multiplication, determinant calculation, and finding the inverse of a matrix,
  all performed under a modular arithmetic system.
- Factory methods for constructing specialized types of matrices like
  Vandermonde matrices, which are useful for solving systems of equations where
  the solution involves polynomial coefficients.

Classes:
- Matrix: Handles creation and manipulation of matrices. Offers methods to
  multiply matrices, calculate determinants, and invert matrices, all within
  the bounds of modular arithmetic defined by the secp256k1 modulus.

Usage:
The Matrix class can be instantiated directly with a 2D tuple representing the
matrix, or via factory methods like `from_vandermonde` which create a
Vandermonde matrix from given indices and a polynomial degree.
